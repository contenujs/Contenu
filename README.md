# Contenu


Contenu is a Json-based content management system that focused on simplicity and efficiency. Until this version, Contenu is useful for the one-page websites. But very soon it will grow for bigger scales.

Managing content with Contenu doesn't need to be done on a separate web page. The managing process will happen on your website using a tiny widget that will be shown on the top-right corner. With the widget, you can manage the fields that are needed on your website.
